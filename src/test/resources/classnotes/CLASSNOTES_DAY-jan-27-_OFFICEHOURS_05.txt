Office hours practice session.

Open Cucumber project
======================

Singleton class -> a class of which we can have only ONE/Single object. And all classes/codes shares the same object.
	-> Single object PER THREAD

Driver class -> is SingleTon with Single driver object class for whole test, when test is running.

SINGLE DRIVER OBJECT -> FOR EACH TEST

When we applied
private static ThreadLocal<WebDriver> driverPool = new ThreadLocal<>();

it is still a singleton class, we just made it in a way that when tests are running in parellel. EACH TEST WILL HAVE ITS OWN SINGLE OBJECT OF DRIVER.

Lets say below 3 tests are running at SAME TIME in Paralell MODE:

Test1 --> running --> Driver1 object
Test2 --> running --> Driver2 object
Test3 --> running --> Driver3 object

static variable -> belongs to class directly, we can access it using the classname.variablename
				-> SHARED variable -> ONE copy of static variable ALWAYS. All objects of the class, share the same Variable.

instance variable -> also called object variables. belongs to object
	-> each object of the class will have its own COPY of the instance variable.
==============================
Driver class is singleton, that also supports multi threading. where each thread will have have its own SINGLE driver object.
==============================

@Murodil we use testNG j-unit and jupiter  for assertion and as i remember parallel test its not working for scenario outline with j-unit so how we can parallel testing  or which one we can say for parallel testing can you please explain it?

In our framework Paralell execution is done by maven-surefire-plugin plugin.
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>

So even if we use Junit/TestNG, it is able to perform paralell execution.
Sure fire plugin treats Scenario Outline as Single Test, thats why it is not opening separate browser for each Test data in Examples table.
==============================

Test1 -> single browser1/driver object for whole test.

CROSS Browser testing: testing application with different browsers like chrome, firefox, internet explorer(RUN), safari

Irina Lazarenko — Today at 4:56 PM
What is we want to do parallell and cross browser testing at the same time in Automation, @Murodil?

So we want to be able to run our tests in paralell mode and in different browsers --> Yes

TestNG.xml can help with that, but not a good approach.

Cleaner approach -> add a jenkins job for each browser type and pass browser type as maven parameter.

jenkins job 1:
mvn clean install -Dbrowser=chrome

jenkins job 2:
mvn clean install -Dbrowser=firefox

We goto jenkins and run each one at same time.
Then each jenkins job will be running tests in paralell

String browserType;
if (System.getProperty("browser") != null) {
     browserType = System.getProperty("browser");
}else {
     browserType = ConfigurationReader.getProperty("browser");
}

If we add above code to our Driver class, then
we are checking if we are passing browser type as a maven parameter (-Dbrowser=chrome). If yes, we are running the tests with that browser, if NOT, we are using browser type that is defined in properties file. (browser=chrome)

INTERVIEW: How do you do parallel execution and in different browsers.

Parallel execution -> maven surefire plugin

cross browser -> I create separate jenkins job for each browser type. and pass browser type as maven parameter -Dbrowser=chrome

When jenkins jobs are running at same time, my tests run in different browsers.

==============================

-Dtags=@regression

-Dtags=@smoke

mvn clean install -Dbrowser=firefox -Dtags=@smoke

==============================

Selenium Grid -> Running tests remotely and multiple browsers.
	-> it is a set up that enables execution of tests in multiple nodes in parallel mode.
	-> enables execution of tests in AWS EC2 cloud Server


Do you have experience with Amazon AWS?

Yes, I use EC2 servers with Selenium grid for remote test execution.
==============================================

- surefire maven plugin -> helps with running tests in parellel mode. -> running multiple tests at same time. for efficiency

- selenium grid -> HUB + nodes set up -> that helps with remote test execution in EC2 cloud servers. and also supports paralell execution of tests

FLOW:
	jenkins starts the job -> maven starts tests execution using surefire plugin -> surefire plugin executes tests in paralell mode -> in Driver class we are using RemoteWebDriver/Selenium grid -> Selenium Grid accepts requests of surefire in paralell mode and runs tests in EC2 remote servers

	All execution reports come back to jenkins as HTML report.
==============================================

How do you execute your tests in parallel mode in your question?

I use maven sure fire plugin to execute tests/scenarios in parallel mode.

And I also use selenium grid to run those tests in AWS EC2 servers remotely.

==============================================

You just mentioned that your Driver class is singleton, and how do you able to run multiple tests at same time if it is singleton?

Right right, i added ThreadLocal to my Driver, so now it supports SINGLE DRIVER for each THREAD/Test.

==============================================

Do you have any experience with CI/CD?
How do you actually execute your smoke tests/regression tests?

Yes, I added Jenkins jobs and scheduled daiiiily execution of smoke tests. Jenkins job runs the tests using Maven command that I specified in jenkins.

When release time comes, normally I manually build regression jenkins job before each release.
==============================================

How do you do reporting in your framework?

I set up maven-cucumber-reporting plugin that generates beautiful and detailed execution report.

Fuat Vural — Today at 6:37 PM
For  reports I use "maven-cucumber-reporting" which is a very detailed reporting tool, Even has the option to show what percentage of which tags are failing and passing.

==============================================
