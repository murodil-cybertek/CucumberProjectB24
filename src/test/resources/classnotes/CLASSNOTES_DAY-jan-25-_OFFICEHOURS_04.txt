UI automation with Cucumber BDD framework

If we have time:
	- add Database validation and Database clean up steps
-----------------------------

process of automation of UI test story:
	-> Analyze/learn the functionality for the test:
			-> BA, Developer, Team/QA Lead, Other QA Testers

	-> Run the test step manually:
		if everything is passing then start automation
		if failing , report the bug

	-> Create a git branch for the Automation user story in local project:

	321-add_spartan_automation

	-> add feature file and write the scenario in gherkin



GIT PROCESS/WorkFlow:
-> I add a new branch for each my automation user story
321-add_spartan_automation(local branch for story) --> commit code and push the branch to github -->
Create pull request in github and add code reviewers -->
code reviewer adds comments for change or just approves -->
make changes/updates locally and push to github branch again -->
code reviewer approves -->
merge your branch to master branch -->
delete your branch
You can goto jira and change the status to "done"

new -> dev in progress -> completed

new -> blocked (if it is failing manually)

=============================================

AUTOMATION PROCESS:

-> add feature file and write the scenario in gherkin
-> generate and add step definition methods
-> if needed add page object and weblements with locators for the pages in the application that are used in the test steps
-> write the steps and do the validations using junit assertions

Open existing cheap CucumberProjectB24

in properties file:

spartan.url=http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8000

replace YOUR_IP_ADDRESS with your AWS EC2 server IP address

if you do not have your own:

   IP-1 :    44.201.134.164        Group 1 to 6
   IP-2 :    54.158.153.204        Group 7 to 12
   IP-3 :    3.84.251.99           Group 13 to 18

it is better if you use your own
